# Bugs

   - Gene Assist
     - Gene Assist has a fun interaction with Void Maps - if you set Gene Assist to keep your breeding timer at 3 seconds, you set HD Farm to farm maps until you can survive one hit in Void Map, and then you jump into Void Gas map, suddenly you can't survive 1 hit anymore because Geneticist were fired to keep up with the breeding timer.

# Settings
   - Rename
     - Prestige Climb settings. 
       - Maybe move the tab that they're in? Could almost definitely be consolidated into the prestige raiding setting but not sure if that's wise. 
         - Might be the type of setting that is better having on view at all times.
